> Currently focusing on class work at the moment, but I do plan on creating more fun things over the future like games. (planning on making a game with friends)

## Likes and Dislikes for the Course
Overall I think the course will be very interesting. I am not looking forward to the massive amounts of reading, however, I do look forward to learning more about specific operating systems and doing more things with my Github.
